# MidiParser
A program to convert MIDI files into a text file to copy into this Scratch project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/406047907/

## How to use
The compiled executable can be found [here](../master/MidiParser/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1):

There's a green button in the upper left area of the page. Click on that, then click "Download ZIP" Extract the zip file, then go to MidiParser >> bin >> Debug >> netcoreapp3.1 You can either run the exe file and paste in the MIDI file path, or you can drag MIDI files onto the exe, and convert them that way. I find the 2nd method easier.
A text file will appear, and you want to open the text file and copy everything in that text file. In Scratch, create a new item in the list, and paste the text you copied into the item. And there you go! You should be able to run the program, and your song will appear. Don't forget to remix the project, so I can see too!

If you drag multiple files onto the exe file, you'll get a file called \_\_AllSongs.txt You can import this file into the \_\_songs list in the Scratch program to add all the songs you converted.
